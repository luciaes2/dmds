    "1. Use the *SGDClassifier* provided by scikit-learn. Set *loss='log'*, *learning_rate='constant'*, *alpha=0.0*, *random_state=191*. Set *n_iter=10*, so that the SGDClassifier will sweep the sample 10 times. The stepsize is defined by the parameter *eta0*. Use 5-fold cross validation to search for a good eta0. \n",
    "2. Implement a variant of logistic regression using stochastic gradient ascent with AdaGrad stepsizes. Make sure that the sample size is 10 times the training set size, so that your classifier sees as many data points as the SGDClassifier.\n",
    "3. Compare your own classifier against the SGDClassifier and LogisticRegression using the function *accuracy_dist()*. Note that, for this you should implement the classifier in its own class which must implement the functions *fit(X,y)* and *score(X,y)*. The trick is to use a class variable for the parameters, e.g., *self.beta*, which can be accessed in both functions. If creating a class seems to difficult a function that does both, fitting and scoring, will also do the trick."
