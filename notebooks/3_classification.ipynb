    "Compare your own classifier against SGDClassifier, LogisticRegression, and the optimal KNeighborsClassifier using the function *accuracy_dist()*. Note that, for this you should implement your own in its own class which must implement the functions *fit(X,y)* and *score(X,y)*. The trick is to use a class variable for the parameters, e.g., *self.beta*, which can be accessed in both functions. If creating a class seems to difficult a function that does both, fitting and scoring, will also do the trick."
